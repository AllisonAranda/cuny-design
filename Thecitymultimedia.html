            <h2>Electronic Design and Multimedia</h2>
            <h2>Degree: B.F.A. </h2>
            <p>The Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Electronic Design and Multimedia is a professional specialization in design for print and interactive media which integrates a variety of digital media into all stages of design and production. </p>
            <p>City College offers a BFA in Electronic Design & Multimedia as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Arts with a Digital Design concentraiton. Every course (with the exception of the BFA Thesis course) can be taken by any CCNY student who has fulfilled the pre-requisite courses.</p>
            <p>The BFA (Bachelors in Fine Arts) is a 75-credit (approximately 24-course) major whereas the BA in Studio Art is a 45-credit (approximately 15-course) major. It is possible to complete either degree in four years, but students in the BFA program usually are not able to take many electives outside of the Art Department offerings.</p>
            <p>BA students’ diplomas with indicated that they have earned a “Bachelor of Arts” degree, whereas BFA students’ diplomas indicate a “Bachelor of Fine Arts in Electronic Design & Multimedia.”</p>
            <p>Unlike the BFA major, BA in Studio Art majors do not have to apply to the major (though the Art Department does require BA students to maintain a 2.5 GPA and take a couple of art courses prior to declaring the major). Further details about the two programs can be found at </p>
