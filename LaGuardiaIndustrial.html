            <h2>Industrial Design</h2>
            <h2>Degree: A.A.S. </h2>
              <p>Industrial Design is a combination of applied sciences, whereby aesthetics, ergonomics, and usability of mass-produced products may be improved for marketability and production.</p>
            <p>The Industrial Design program, coordinated by the Humanities Department leads to an Associate of Applied Science Degree (AAS), and is proud to be the only program of its kind in New York. The role of an industrial designer is to create and execute design solutions towards problems of form, usability, user ergonomics, engineering, marketing, brand development and sales. The Industrial Design program provides students a foundation experience in the necessary skills to begin a career in Computer Assisted Design (CAD), Model making, Product Design and Fabrication or transfer to a four-year institution.</p>
