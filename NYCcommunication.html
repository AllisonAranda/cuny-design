            <h2>Communication Design</h2>
            <h2>Degree: A.A.S. </h2>
            <p>The AAS degree program in Communication Design provides students with a solid foundation in the theory and current practices of the Communication Design profession and a grounding in general education. Students explore visual expression through a range of courses in figure drawing, design and color, typography, photography and web design. The program prepares students to continue on to upper-level course work and specialization in the design field. Graduates have a broad knowledge of the design profession, a solid foundation in liberal arts and sciences and a well-rounded portfolio. They are prepared to assist art directors and designers in entry-level positions in Communication Design.</p>
            <p>New York City, a leading center of communication design in the United States with over 2,000 advertising agencies, design studios, publishing and new media companies, offers graduates many possibilities for full-time or free-lance employment in the field. Many graduates have gone on to earn baccalaureate and graduate degrees in the fields of advertising design, graphic design, fine arts and art education.</p>
            <p>Placement in the Associate Program:</p>
            <p>Placement in the associate in applied science program requires a high school diploma or GED. Students need not have majored in art in high school, but it is desirable that entering students have taken some prior courses in typography, layout, design and drawing or painting.</p>
            <p>Advanced Standing Credits</p>
            <p>The student admitted as a transfer is advised to go to the Office of the Registrar to obtain an application for advanced standing and file it with the Registrar during the announced fling period. Since there are differences in communication design courses offerings from one college to another, each application for advanced standing credits will be reviewed individually. Credit will be granted for courses taken at other colleges if the courses are considered equivalent to those offered at New York City College of Technology. Final determination of credits for advanced standing will be made by the Registrar and the Chair of the Communication Design Department.</p>
