            <h2>Degree: B.F.A. </h2>
            <p> Queens College’s Design program combines knowledgeable faculty with industry standard software and the creativity of a studio-based learning environment.

Whether you’re interested in pursuing more hand-drawn approaches that utilize traditional media, or you want to immerse yourself fully in digital media and software, our Design program has the flexibility and diversity for each student to hone their vision. Additionally, our program has a network of internships that allow students to get real-world experience as a designer while receiving college credit and building their resume.</p>
            <h3>Program Educational Outcomes</h3>
            <p>The objectives of the Communication Design Baccalaureate degree are to prepare students to:</p>
            <p>-Function as designers in a professional context or pursue graduate level study in design.</p>
            <p>-Create a portfolio that represents the student's conceptual and visual problem solving abilities.</p>
