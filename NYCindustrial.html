            <h2>Industrial Design Technology</h2>
            <h2>Degree: A.A.S. </h2>
            <p>The Industrial Design Technology (IND) program is designed to provide students with a wide variety of valuable skills enabling them to utilize a number of 2D, 3D and animation/simulation software packages in several diverse fields. Job titles for graduates of this program include design manager, animation developer, industrial design systems manager, industrial product designer, project manager, CAD/CAM programmer and mechanical designer.</p>
            <p>The Industrial Design Technology Program Educational Objectives are as Follows</p>
            <p>-Graduates should be able to be employed in entry-level positions as industrial designers, CAD animation technicians, junior/senior quality assurance inspectors, skilled/junior testing technicians, CAD simulation technicians and quality technicians.</p>
            <p>-Graduates should be able to be enrolled in a four-year Industrial Design/Mechanical Engineering/Technology-related program to continue their study.</p>
            <p>-Graduates should practice effective oral, written and graphical communication skills.</p>
            <p>The core of the program is a sequence of courses in CAD, beginning with the fundamental concepts of orthographic projection. Students begin to utilize CAD in the first and second semesters of a sequence with an emphasis on three-dimensional design. In the third semester, students learn industrial design processes and animation. They also learn to utilize CAD and other design software to produce technical illustrations which can be integrated into conventional computer-based publications. In the final semester, students learn to utilize one or more additional CAD software packages appropriate to industrial product design and to transfer CAD data to computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems. They learn to apply engineering design methodologies to real-world engineering problems using computer simulation and animation.</p>
            <p>Building on the fundamental concepts of mathematics and physics, the program also develops the studentâ€™s creative problem-solving capabilities with courses in strength of materials and computer programming. In addition, a course in engineering materials gives the student a storehouse of practical knowledge about the behavior of materials. Finally, a course in industrial design processes provides students with an opportunity to utilize all of these capabilities to carry out original design projects similar to those encountered in industry.</p>
            <p>Employers of graduates of this program include industrial product design companies, automotive industry, aerospace industry, architecture and construction companies, Scott Jordan Furniture Inc., Con Edison, National Grid, Verizon, Comco Plastics Inc., Metallized Carbon Co. and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
